In this Java tutorial, you will learn about Types of Errors in Java
There are three types of error in java which are as follows:

Syntax errors ---> A syntactical error in Java code is one in which the language you use to create your code is incorrect. For example, if you try to create an if statement that doesn't include the condition in parentheses, even when the condition is present on the same line as the if statement, that's a syntax error.

Logical errors ---> Logical Error: A logic error is when your program compiles and executes, but does the wrong thing or returns an incorrect result or no output when it should be returning an output.

Runtime errors(also called Exceptions) ---> Runtime errors/Exceptions occur when a program does not contain any syntax errors but asks the computer to do something that the computer is unable to reliably do. It is the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) which detects it while the program is running.

Note: Error and Exceptions are different words with different meaning
