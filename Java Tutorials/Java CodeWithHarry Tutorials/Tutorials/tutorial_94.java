In this advance Java tutorial, you will learn about what is Hashing and why to use it
An algorithm that does the mapping of data to a hash of fixed size is called the hashing algorithm. Hashing algorithm in Java is a cryptographic hash function. A hash algorithm or hash function is designed in such a way that it behaves like a one-way function. One way means it is not possible to do the inversion, i.e., retrieving the original value from the hash is not possible.
