In this advance Java tutorial, you will learn about Collections Framework

A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. All collections frameworks contain the following:
Interfaces
Implementations
Algorithms

Apart from the Java Collections Framework, the best-known examples of collections frameworks are the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) and Smalltalk's collection hierarchy. Historically, collections frameworks have been quite complex, which gave them a reputation for having a steep learning curve. We believe that the Java Collections Framework breaks with this tradition, as you will learn for yourself in this chapter.
